## Choropleth Map

[map1.html] is a choropleth map that shows each US county's COVID infection rate. This map is interactive by utilizing JavaScript so that when you hover your mouse over a certain county, it will show that county's infection rate. The population data for calculating the case rates are from the 2018 ACS 5 year estimates.



## Proportional Symbol Map

[map2.html] is a proportional symbol map that shows the number of COVID cases in each US county. Each county has a bubble around it and the cases number will dictate the size and color of that bubble. Counties with higher case numbers will be larger and a darker color, and counties with lower case numbers will be smaller and lighter. The data used in this map is from New York Times.
